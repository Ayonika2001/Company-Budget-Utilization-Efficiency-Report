## 🗂️ Project Components

### 🔹 1. **Employee Work-Hour Table**

- Tracks weekly and monthly work hours across projects (A to R)
- Total hours and hourly rate used to compute **labor costs**
- Segregated by companies and project types

### 🔹 2. **Budget Table**

- Initial Budget Allocation (Fixed per project)
- Monthly Burn Rate and Total Burnt Amount
- **Remaining Budget = Total Budget - Spent Amount**
- Conditional formatting:
  - 🔴 Red: <10% remaining
  - 🟡 Yellow: <25% remaining
